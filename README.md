# Build Your Own Redis in Rust

This project is to build a toy Redis-Server clone that's capable of parsing Redis protocol and handling basic Redis commands, parsing and initializing Redis from RDB file,
supporting leader-follower replication, redis streams.

You can find all the source code and commit history in [my github repo](https://github.com/fangpin/redis-rs).

## Main features

+ Handle basic Redis commands
+ Parse and initialize Redis from RDB file
+ Leader-follower Replication

## Prerequisites
install `redis-cli` first (an implementation of redis client for test purpose)
```sh
cargo install mini-redis
```

### RDB file format overview
Here are the different sections of the [RDB file](https://rdb.fnordig.de/file_format.html), in order:
+ Header section
+ Metadata section
+ Database section
+ End of file section
#### Header section
start with some magic number
```sh
52 45 44 49 53 30 30 31 31  // Magic string + version number (ASCII): "REDIS0011".
```
#### Metadata section
contains zero or more "metadata subsections", which each specify a single metadata attribute
e.g.
```sh
FA                             // Indicates the start of a metadata subsection.
09 72 65 64 69 73 2D 76 65 72  // The name of the metadata attribute (string encoded): "redis-ver".
06 36 2E 30 2E 31 36           // The value of the metadata attribute (string encoded): "6.0.16".
```
#### Database section
contains zero or more "database subsections," which each describe a single database.
e.g.
```sh
FE                       // Indicates the start of a database subsection.
00                       /* The index of the database (size encoded). Here, the index is 0. */

FB                       // Indicates that hash table size information follows.
03                       /* The size of the hash table that stores the keys and values (size encoded).  Here, the total key-value hash table size is 3. */
02                       /* The size of the hash table that stores the expires of the keys (size encoded).  Here, the number of keys with an expiry is 2. */
```

```sh
00                       /* The 1-byte flag that specifies the valueâ€™s type and encoding.  Here, the flag is 0, which means "string." */
06 66 6F 6F 62 61 72     // The name of the key (string encoded). Here, it's "foobar".
06 62 61 7A 71 75 78     // The value (string encoded). Here, it's "bazqux".
```

```sh
FC                       /* Indicates that this key ("foo") has an expire, and that the expire timestamp is expressed in milliseconds. */
15 72 E7 07 8F 01 00 00  /* The expire timestamp, expressed in Unix time, stored as an 8-byte unsigned long, in little-endian (read right-to-left).  Here, the expire timestamp is 1713824559637. */
00                       // Value type is string.
03 66 6F 6F              // Key name is "foo".
03 62 61 72              // Value is "bar".
```

```sh
FD                       /* Indicates that this key ("baz") has an expire, and that the expire timestamp is expressed in seconds. */
52 ED 2A 66              /* The expire timestamp, expressed in Unix time, stored as an 4-byte unsigned integer, in little-endian (read right-to-left).  Here, the expire timestamp is 1714089298. */
00                       // Value type is string.
03 62 61 7A              // Key name is "baz".
03 71 75 78              // Value is "qux".
```

In summary, 
- Optional expire information (one of the following):
  - Timestamp in seconds:
    - FD
    - Expire timestamp in seconds (4-byte unsigned integer)
  - Timestamp in milliseconds:
    - FC
    - Expire timestamp in milliseconds (8-byte unsigned long)
- Value type (1-byte flag)
- Key (string encoded)
- Value (encoding depends on value type)

#### End of file section
```sh
FF                       /* Indicates that the file is ending, and that the checksum follows. */
89 3b b7 4e f8 0f 77 19  // An 8-byte CRC64 checksum of the entire file.
```

#### Size encoding
```sh
/* If the first two bits are 0b00:
   The size is the remaining 6 bits of the byte.
   In this example, the size is 10: */
0A
00001010

/* If the first two bits are 0b01:
   The size is the next 14 bits
   (remaining 6 bits in the first byte, combined with the next byte),
   in big-endian (read left-to-right).
   In this example, the size is 700: */
42 BC
01000010 10111100

/* If the first two bits are 0b10:
   Ignore the remaining 6 bits of the first byte.
   The size is the next 4 bytes, in big-endian (read left-to-right).
   In this example, the size is 17000: */
80 00 00 42 68
10000000 00000000 00000000 01000010 01101000

/* If the first two bits are 0b11:
   The remaining 6 bits specify a type of string encoding.
   See string encoding section. */
```

#### String encoding
+ The size of the string (size encoded).
+ The string.
```sh
/* The 0x0D size specifies that the string is 13 characters long.  The remaining characters spell out "Hello, World!". */
0D 48 65 6C 6C 6F 2C 20 57 6F 72 6C 64 21
```
For sizes that begin with 0b11, the remaining 6 bits indicate a type of string format:
```sh
/* The 0xC0 size indicates the string is an 8-bit integer. In this example, the string is "123". */
C0 7B

/* The 0xC1 size indicates the string is a 16-bit integer. The remaining bytes are in little-endian (read right-to-left).  In this example, the string is "12345". */
C1 39 30

/* The 0xC2 size indicates the string is a 32-bit integer.  The remaining bytes are in little-endian (read right-to-left), In this example, the string is "1234567". */
C2 87 D6 12 00

/* The 0xC3 size indicates that the string is compressed with the LZF algorithm.  You will not encounter LZF-compressed strings in this challenge. */
C3 ...
```

## Replication
Redis server [leader-follower replication](https://redis.io/docs/management/replication/).
Run multiple Redis servers with one acting as the "master" and the others as "replicas". Changes made to the master will be automatically replicated to replicas.

### Send Handshake (follower -> master)
1. When the follower starts, it will send a PING command to the master as RESP Array.
2. Then 2 REPLCONF (replication config) commands are sent to master from follower to communicate the port and the sync protocol. One is *REPLCONF listening-port <PORT>* and the other is *REPLCONF capa psync2*. psnync2 is an example sync protocol supported in this project.
3. The follower sends the *PSYNC* command to master with replication id and offset to start the replication process.

### Receive Handshake (master -> follower)
1. Response a PONG message to follower.
2. Response an OK message to follower for both REPLCONF commands.
3. Response a *+FULLRESYNC <REPL_ID> 0\r\n* to follower with the replication id and offset.

### RDB file transfer
When the follower starts, it sends a *PSYNC ? -1* command to tell master that it doesn't have any data yet, and needs a full resync.

Then the master send a *FULLRESYNC* response to the follower as an acknowledgement.

Finally, the master send the RDB file to represent its current state to the follower. The follower should load the RDB file received to the memory, replacing its current state.

### Receive write commands (master -> follower)
The master sends following write commands to the follower with the offset info.
The sending is to reuse the same TCP connection of handshake and RDB file transfer.
As the all the commands are encoded as RESP Array just like a normal client command, so the follower could reuse the same logic to handler the replicate commands from master. The only difference is the commands are coming from the master and no need response back.


## Streams
A stream is identified by a key, and it contains multiple entries.
Each entry consists of one or more key-value pairs, and is assigned a unique ID.
[More about redis streams](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/data-types/streams/)
[Radix tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_tree)


It looks like a list of key-value pairs.
```sh
entries:
  - id: 1526985054069-0 # (ID of the first entry)
    temperature: 36 # (A key value pair in the first entry)
    humidity: 95 # (Another key value pair in the first entry)

  - id: 1526985054079-0 # (ID of the second entry)
    temperature: 37 # (A key value pair in the first entry)
    humidity: 94 # (Another key value pair in the first entry)

  # ... (and so on)

```

Examples of Redis stream use cases include:
- Event sourcing (e.g., tracking user actions, clicks, etc.)
- Sensor monitoring (e.g., readings from devices in the field)
- Notifications (e.g., storing a record of each user's notifications in a separate stream)
